# Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3]'
#
# Given an integer array nums of unique elements, return all possible subsets
# (the power set).
#
# The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in
# any order.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: nums = [1,2,3]
# Output: [[],[1],[2],[1,2],[3],[1,3],[2,3],[1,2,3]]
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: nums = [0]
# Output: [[],[0]]
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= nums.length <= 10
# -10 <= nums[i] <= 10
# All the numbers ofÂ nums are unique.

class Solution:
    # Each num can be the empty set or itself, plus those same 2 choices for the other n-1 remaining
    # So for each n there is 2^n possibilities, making this O(n * 2^n) time complexity in the best case.

            # left decision tree, include nums[i]
            subset.append(nums[i])

            # right decision tree, DON'T include nums[i] which was just appended, so pop it
